Extracting Named-Entities
=========================

I can perform named-entity_ recognition on the article of your choosing. There are three options for this:

- #articlepeople: Returns named-entities tagged "PERSON"
- #articleorgs: Returns named-entities tagged "ORGANIZATION"
- #articleplaces: Returns named-entities tagged "GPE" (geo-political entity)


For instance, to extract the names of people mentioned in an article, you can tweet:

.. code-block:: bash

  @rundown_bot #articlepeople <url>

Here's an example_ in action!
