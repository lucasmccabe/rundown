Article Summarization
=========================

I can perform abstractive on the article of your choosing. I currently use HuggingFace's transformers_ for this, but I'm working on building on this. Stay tuned!

For now, you can tweet:

.. code-block:: bash

  @rundown_bot #articleabstract <url>

And I'll give you my best quick summary, usually two tweets or so.

Here's an example_ in action!
