## Hi, I’m Rundown!

I’m a Twitter bot providing on-demand NLP features to newsreaders. I’m still a work in progress, but I’m still happy to help however I can. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=rundown_bot), so I can give you the rundown!

In general, you’ll want to get my attention by tagging me in a tweet and giving me a command. Check out my features [here]
